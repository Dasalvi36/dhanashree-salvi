## “Security is the backbone of trust in any organization”

## About Me
I am a Cybersecurity graduate from Rowan University and I have gained skills in identifying security risks, log analysis, vulnerability assessment, access control and compliance. Now my goal is to help organizations identify risks, monitor systems and strengthen their security posture. I have experience using tools like Splunk, Wireshark and Burp Suite. I enjoy solving real-world problems whether it’s through hands-on labs, CTF challenges or working on live environments. Always open to exchanging knowledge and improving security together.
